    "description": "Homo ludens has never been a species, but it is a perfect essence of the human nature. Through play, we socialize and prepare ourselves for the world in the first years of our lives, and carry that experience on in how we connect to stories, characters and other players as adults. Games create worlds where we are no mere bystanders to an art piece but direct collaborators, essential parts of the process. \n\nGames are art pieces for which engagement is essential. \n\nFind the next ARTifact where the sound originates."
