  "description": "Having started as a utility aspect of our lives, clothes and shoes eventually became a means of communication. Fabrics, shapes, accents â€” this is how we broadcast ourselves to the outside world effortlessly, finding bits that resonate with us in others creations. \n\nWith fashion, we tailor ourselves and many others across times and borders. \n\nFind the next ARTifact where human creativity is most at play."
