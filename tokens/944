  "description": "Human civilization is imprinted in visual depictions. Our roots lie in primitive cave drawings and take us all the way to the most elaborate experiences of today, created by a single visionary or collective. \n\nBeing artistic means being human. \n\nFind the next ARTifact where what we wear looks like it never wears down."
